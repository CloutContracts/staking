# CloutContracts Staking
CCS holders who have CCS on the Ethereum Mainnet can now stake some of their CSS for a certain period of time, and receive CCS on top of their staked amount as a reward. To insure trust, the Solidity code that this DApp interacts with is verified and viewable on Etherscan. On Binance, the option to stake CloutContracts_Peg is available. Please keep in mind, this isn't investment or financial advice. CloutContracts is to be looked at as a utility.
